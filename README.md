# the-recipe-api

I'll be updating this post regularly when major changes happen.
The idea is to make an RESTful api, filled with some data (recipes) and whoever wants to use this recipes and add more recipes is welcome to do so.

## Endpoints

/recipes
- GET
- POST

/recipes(id)

- GET
- POST
- UPDATE
- DELETE

I will work in autheritation too so only a user is able to delete or update it's own recipes.
